# searx2

Ideas for a asciimoo/searx like metasearch-engine

I did a leittle bit of work on https://github.com/asciimoo/searx, a great project with the right ideas:
- Open Source (with a copyleft license)
- Privacy by design first
  - proxying all ressources that are automatically loaded from third-party sides
  - Optional (js cleaned) proxying of results via the morty proxy


I still see room for improvements, so this is just my fantasy, of how a project like this could be structured and run:

## The Project

- Developed on Github for maximal exposure.
- Slave-Git server on private infrastructure, in case anything goes wrong.
- Documentation on 

### Contributers

- **Admins:** 2 persons with admin privileges. They bundle up releases
